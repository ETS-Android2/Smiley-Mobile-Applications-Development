# Smiley

“Smiley” is a motivational app that has three simple goals to improve mental health, to boost productivity and to popularise donation. The three mentioned topics are controversial and emotive issues in today’s society, living in hectic pace life, which too late starts paying attention on their mentality and inner peace. The application will be part of the user’s daily routine because it will provide a unique motivational content each morning. “Smiley” will send a morning notification on the user phone displaying part of the topics that the particular day’s articles will be displayed on the profile home’s page. The content for reading will be engaging, teaching on core life values and suggesting methods on how to increase productivity or stay focused. The other feature that is going to be implemented is the Android Machine Learning Face Detection Kit from where the inspiration of the app name comes from. The main feature of the app is to take a picture of your face smiling that detects your face and if smiling, unlocks you a motivational quote that will serve as a mantra for the day. This will improve the user’s mood and motivate them to keep going throughout the day. After receiving your daily motivation and smiling the app will display a pop-up window inviting the user by displaying a text saying “Now it’s time for you to make someone smile. Find out more in the Donate section.” to the Donation page of the app. This page the application will present information on a particular world organisation or charity that is in need of resources, volunteering or financial support. The section will follow with a section for donation leading the user to Google Pay. Moreover, Google adds will be added and all the money from them will go directly for the chosen organisation. “Smiley” will make people feel better, live better and do good. “Smiley” will work for people and be inspired by people.
